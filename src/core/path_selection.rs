//! Generic path selection strategy.
//!
//! A universally optimal path selection strategy remains an open problem. The [`PathSelection`]
//! trait allows for the path selection strategy to vary between executors. Certain executors may
//! want an exhaustive path search, where all feasible paths are covered. While others may sacrifice
//! soundness using some sort of heuristics.

/// A `Path` represents a single path of execution through a program. The path is composed by the
/// current execution state (`State`) and an optional constraint that will be asserted when this
/// path begins executing.
///
/// A single path may produce multiple other paths when encountering branching paths of execution.

    /// Constraints to add before starting execution on this path.
